Creating a README file is a great way to provide documentation and instructions for your project. Here’s a sample README for your Movie Database Flask application:

# Movie Database Flask

A simple Flask web application that allows users to search for movies, view detailed information, and rate them. The application uses the OMDb API to fetch movie data and stores user ratings in a SQLite database.

## Features

- Search for movies by title.
- View detailed information about each movie.
- Rate movies and store ratings in a database.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Requests

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YahyaHassan1914/Movie-Database-Flask.git
   cd movie-database-flask
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the API key:**

   - Create a file named `api_key.json` in the root directory of the project.
   - Add your OMDb API key to the `api_key.json` file in the following format:

     ```json
     {
         "api_key": "your_actual_api_key_here"
     }
     ```

5. **Initialize the database:**

   Run the Flask application to create the SQLite database:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This will also start the development server.

## Usage

1. **Start the Flask server:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser and go to:**

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

   You can now use the application to search for movies, view details, and rate them.

## Project Structure

```

## Requirements File

The `requirements.txt` file should contain the necessary Python packages:

```
Flask
Flask-SQLAlchemy
requests
```

## Troubleshooting

- **FileNotFoundError**: Ensure `api_key.json` is present and correctly formatted.
- **Requests Exception**: Check your network connection and ensure the OMDb API service is available.
